**Project 11:** Finding similar customers to a given customer, predicting insurance benefits, data masking
**Task:** Build models to find similar customers for marketing department. Build model to predict if new customer is likely to receive an insurance benefit. Predict number of insurance benefits a customer is likely to receive. Protect clients' personal data without breaking models. <br>
**Skills demonstrated:** Created a KNearestNeighbors function to find similar customers and evaluated with Euclidean distance metric and Manhattan distance metric on both scaled and unscaled data. Use confusionmatrix and KNN Classifier to predict probabilities of new customers filing an insurance benefit. Created a simple Linear Regression model with an equation to calculate the best-fit coefficients(weights) for the LR model. Trained and evaluated LR model on scaled and unscaled data to predict number of benefits a customer is likely to receive. <br>
Obfuscated data to protect clients' personal information. Showed I was able to mask the data then recover it. Ran the masked data through the Linear Regression model and received identical results as unmasked data, showing that the obfuscation process does not affect the results of our trained model.
